\section{Future Nuclear Projections}

The future of nuclear energy in \gls{EU} nations is organized
in the table by the World Nuclear Association \cite{world_nuclear_association_nuclear_2017}.
It is assumed in the simulations that all the planned constructions 
are completed on their expected date without delay
or failure. Also, the newly constructed nuclear power plants are assumed to have a lifetime of 60 years.

\Cref{tab:eu_deployment} lists the reactors that are currently  planned or under construction.

For each nation, the growth trajectory is categorized from
``Aggressive Growth'' to ``Aggressive Shutdown''. Aggressive growth is
characterized by a rigorous expansion of nuclear power while 
Aggressive Shutdown is characterized as a transition to rapidly
de-nuclearize the nation's electric grid. A nation's growth trajectory is
categorized into five degrees depending on x, 
given by $\frac{Nuclear\ capacity\ in\ 2040}{Nuclear\ capacity\ in\ 2017}$.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Aggressive Growth ($x \geq 2$)
	\item Modest Growth ($1.2 \leq x < 2$)
	\item Maintenance ($0.8 \leq x < 1.2$)
	\item Modest Reduction ($0.5 \leq x< 0.8$)
	\item Aggressive Reduction ($x \leq 0.5$)
\end{itemize}

The growth trajectory and specific plan of each \gls{EU} nation 
is listed in Table \ref{tab:eu_growth}.
