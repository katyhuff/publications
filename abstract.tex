        We used the \Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator to explore the 
        feasibility of enabling a French transition to an \gls{SFR} fleet by 
        using \gls{UNF} from other \gls{EU} nations.  \Cyclus simulation 
        tracked the \gls{UNF} and tails inventories accumulated in the \gls{EU} 
        from 1970 to 2050. In the same simulation, the French transition to 
        \glspl{SFR} relied on reprocessing the \gls{UNF} inventory 
        accumulated by the \gls{EU} nations. Additional sensitivity analyses 
        determined the impact of reactor lifetime extensions on the dynamics of 
        this transition. These simulations demonstrate that France can avoid 
        deployment of additional \glspl{LWR} by accepting \gls{UNF} from other 
        \gls{EU} nations.
